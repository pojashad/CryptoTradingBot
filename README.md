# CryptoTradingBot
Buy low, sell high? That sounds easy right? 
I am an easy subject of my feelings and when shit starts to hit the fan. I make dumb decisions. How about getting rid of my feelings and let a bot do the work for me? 

The main purpose of this project is to learn/get better at:
- Python
- Crypto
- Trading Crypto
- Pandas & Numpy

And if i could make some passive income on this (REALLY LOW ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING) i could take my brother out for pizza. 

Why crypto? Because it trades 24/7 and i am not restricted to specific times and days.
